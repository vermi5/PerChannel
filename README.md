# PerChannel
Modded plugins for SignalRGB  supported ARGB controllers that allow the user to select RGB color order per channel.

Currently supported controllers:
- Razer Chroma ARGB controller
- Corsair Lightining Node Pro
- Zalman ZÂ·SYNC
- ASUS Motherboards PIDs 0x18F3, 0x19AF, 0x1939

If you want to contribute ways to handle the color order per component instead of per channel, you're more than welcome to do so.
Also, these are all pretty jank and outdated compared to Signal's and their Shutdown color thing doesn't work (except for ASUS motherboards).

These will probably be deprecated soon as SignalRGB will have a way to handle this internally in the future.
